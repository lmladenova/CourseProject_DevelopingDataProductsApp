## Instructions

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## Your Shiny Application

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
5. The application must include the following:

- Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
- Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
- Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
- You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
- The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

## Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

## Here's what you need

1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
3. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box
4. Your presentation must satisfy the following

- It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
- It must be 5 pages
- It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
- It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

## Review criteria: Your Shiny Application

1. Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?
2. Did the application run as described in the documentation?
3. Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?
4. Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?
5. Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
6. Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? 
7. Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.

## Review Criteria: Your Reproducible Pitch

1. Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?
2. Was it 5 pages?
3. Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
4. Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
5. Was it hosted on github or Rpubs?
6. Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
7. Here's your opportunity to give this presentation a +1 for being well done. 8. Did they tinker around with the default style? Was the presentation particularly lucid and well organized? In other words, the student made a legitimate try.
There were no R errors displayed in the presentation.
