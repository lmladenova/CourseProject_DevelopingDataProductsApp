# Overview of the Road Safety Explorer Application

This application is designed to explore the New York City sites of motor vehicle collisions with an impact on non-motorists between January' 2012 and December' 2016. Specifically, the application explores the instances where a motor vehicle collision resulted in an *injury/death* of a *pedestrian/cyclist*.

The application consists of several easy to use tools and to follow are some instructions how to use it.

# How to Use

### INTERACTIVE MAP

##### Step 1: 
Go to the "Interactive Map" tab (it may take a while for the map to load).

##### Step 2:
Select the "Category" and "Impact".

##### Step 3: 
Select the "Borough".

- if **no**, then all of the boroughs will be assumed in the subsequent calculations;

- if **yes**, you will be able to narrow your scope to one, or several boroughs of interest. Once you select particular borough(s), you can proceed to **step 4**.

##### Step 4:
Select one, or more "Zip Code". Keep in mind that there might be zip codes with no records for the search you are interested in. In this case, a message will render bellow. 

##### Step 5:
Select the "Month" and "Time". These two inputs are outputs as well. Once you go through some of the preceding steps, these plots will render/update and will show visually the monthly and hourly trends of the accidents in the geographical area you have selected. 

To select month(s)/ time(s) of interest, click and drag in the plot. A red box will appear over the selected area. Once you make one selection the other plot will update again.

For example, when no selections are made, all months and times are assumed. If you select let's say "Jan-Mar", the time plot will update with the hourly trend of the accidents during the months January through March.

To clear the brush selection, click anywhere in the plot area.

##### Step 6:
After you make all of the desired selections, click on the "Update" button for the map to update. The map shows the sites where at least one motor-vehicle-collision related injury/ death has occurred. The markers are clustered, to view the single points zoom in. To view the specifics, click the marker.

Note: You can reorder the above mentioned step in a way that best suits your search.

### FILTERED DATA

No actions are needed. Once you update the map (with the "Update" button), this table updates with the specifics of your map selections.
